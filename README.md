# is it a language really ?

i lack formal education about modern computer programming.
i dont even know how to write good enough English.
i met my first computer Apple IIe ...
after two weeks and a book about motorola 6502 ...
bang! writing hex code was easier than speaking/writing English (lol @ me)

just works is my only moto.

following my always relaxed pace i will write and publish here some of my ORIGINAL work.
garbage or not , we will see !
